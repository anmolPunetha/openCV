# openCV
Welcome to an exciting series of openCV library developed by me.
It contains many basic and advanced features which are enough for anyone to learn openCV.
It also includes some projects based on the library.

Chapters-Contains various openCV functions from scratch.

Projects:
  1. Attendence System- Using face recognition library, the system first senses the faces present in the webcam and then tests it with the      images beforehand(saved in the folder). And if it matches, then the time when the person firstly comes is saved in a .csv file.
  2. Virtual Paint- Detects the color and then we can write or draw virtually on the screen with that color.
  3. Document Scanner- Detects the image, warps it and then cropps it so that possibly best way is the image shown.
  4. HSV picker- Helps to detect the color for setting it's mask
